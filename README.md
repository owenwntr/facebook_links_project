__To replicate:__

Download British Election Study Combined Wave 1-21 Internet Panel here: 
[https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/british-election-study-combined-wave-1-21-internet-panel/](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/british-election-study-combined-wave-1-21-internet-panel/)
and save in working directory as "BES.dta"

All analysis in most code is in `SCI and Leave Voting.Rmd`. Currently some chunks are set to `eval=FALSE` for faster knitting.

Some data wrangling occurs in `scripts/nuts_data.R`
